## Ansible integration

With the Ansible collection for Micetro you can manage
a Micetro installation through Ansible. The Ansible modules and
plugins connect to the Micetro API and perform all needed
actions.

The collection needs to be installed on the Ansible control node and
Ansible needs to be configured so that the collection can be found by
Ansible.

For the complete documentation, see the `docs` directory or read the
