== Ansible setup for Men&Mice Micetro

With the Ansible setup for Men&Mice Micetro you can manage a Men&Mice
installation through Ansible. The Ansible modules and plugins connect to
the Men&Mice Micetro API and perform all needed actions.

The modules and plugins need to be installed on the Ansible control
node, often called the Ansible Master and Ansible needs to be configured
so that the modules and plugins can be found by Ansible.

=== Installation

Installing the Ansible modules and plugins is a straight forward
process, just install from the Ansible Galaxy.

[source,bash]
----
ansible-galaxy collection install menandmice.ansible_micetro
----

==== Requirements

The Ansible integration modules and plugins do not need anything beyond
a standard Ansible installation. The minimum Ansible version is 2.9 and
up and the required Python version is 3.6+.
